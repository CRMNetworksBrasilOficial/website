"When Sarah Allen sent out a Railsbridge newsletter this morning
announcing EngineYard's release of Rails Installer, I knew I had to
give it try right away. I've built and released Windows applications,
so I know how much it requires to "get it right." And the Rails
Installer gets it right. From clicking on the download link to running
the Rails new application page took about three and half minutes.
Since I also run Ruby, Rails, Git and MySQL on a full blown
cygwin installation - on the same Windows Vista machine -
I was most impressed.  Everything worked exactly as it should."
